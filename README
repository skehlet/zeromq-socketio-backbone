This is a test project using ZeroMQ, Socket.IO, and Backbone.

Start by launching the server.js process. This starts up an Express web server
listening on 8080.  Connect with a web browser to port 8080.  This server also
starts a ZeroMQ pull socket listening on 3000.

You can then run blast.js to send a string over the ZMQ socket with the current 
date every 1/2 second.  Or run send.js to send strings from stdin directly to
the browser.

In the HTML, I use Backbone to dynamically update the page.
